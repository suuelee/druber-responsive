# druber-responsive

## Issue

"You and your friends are developing a new start-up called DRUBER, a drone-based ride share application that carries you to your destination. The original specification was to develop a web page that works in 1920x1080 however your company has realized that it is missing an entire market of smartphone users. Describe how you can modify your code to work in smartphone resolutions e.g. 750x1334 (iPhone 8). Please give specific examples where possible, but do not implement an entire DRUBER clone!"

## Why is mobile compatibility important? 

## What is my solution? 

Responsive design! 

### ❓What is responsive design?

Responsive design accounts for the size of the user's screen and adjusts accordingly; this allows for compatability with all devices. 

## Assumptions
Although this solution can be widely applied across different languages and frameworks, I have chosen to use vanilla HTML/CSS for the purposes of this demonsration. 

## How will my solution be achieved? 

In order to make Druber's web page responsive, I will be using: 

1) Media Queries – Styling elements based on viewport width 
3) Flexbox – Layout model that dynamically arranges elements depending on available free space

## Solution implementation 
1. Firstly, I must add a "viewport" `<meta>`tag to control the viewport's size and shape

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />`

This will ensure that the browser is aware of the device's dimensions.
