# druber-responsive

### Please note: 
To help illustrate my explanation, I've created a (*very*) basic (and visually unappealing) landing page for DRUBER. Please feel free to take a look at the source code above (the focus was on making the page responsive, not on the design). 

## Issue

"You and your friends are developing a new start-up called DRUBER, a drone-based ride share application that carries you to your destination. The original specification was to develop a web page that works in 1920x1080 however your company has realized that it is missing an entire market of smartphone users. Describe how you can modify your code to work in smartphone resolutions e.g. 750x1334 (iPhone 8). Please give specific examples where possible, but do not implement an entire DRUBER clone!"

## Why is mobile compatibility important? 

> Globally, 68.1% of all website visits in 2020 came from mobile devices‚Äîan increase from 63.3% in 2019.

When was the last time you called an Uber from your laptop? You've probably never done that before! Similarly, customers will likely be interacting with DRUBER through their phones, and it's absolutely critical to accomodate to these mobile users. Poor web design drives users away and increases bounce rates ‚Äì in order to fully capture our market, we must create a seamless experience for all customers, on all devices. 

## What is my solution? 

üì±Responsive design using media queries 

### ‚ùìWhat is responsive design? 

Responsive design accounts for the size of the user's screen and adjusts the display of content accordingly; this allows for compatability with all devices. 

### ‚ùìWhy media queries?

Media queries will allow me to style elements based on viewport width. 

## Where do we start? 
1. Before diving into the code, it's crucial to understand that this issue impacts *both* developers *and* designers. Before diving head first into the code, it's a good idea to work together **to create a separate wireframe** for mobile. This will allow the team to collectively work through the structure of the website and establish expectations. 
2. Once the wireframe has been completed, I would delegate the pages of the website among the developers to ensure full coverage and avoid overlap. This will also help us to prevent merge conflicts and to work at a faster pace. 

## Solution Implementation + Example
To illustrate the process of making DRUBER mobile-compatible, I will be using a mock landing page as an example. Right now, it is only compatible with desktop (1920x1080). As shown below, the webpage becomes extremely unreadable and poorly formatted as the size of the screen narrows.

### Where do I start? ANOTHER NAME FOR THIS

First and foremost, I must make sure that there is a "viewport" `<meta>`tag to control the viewport's size and shape: 

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />`

This will ensure that the browser is aware of the device's dimensions. 

Next, I notice that this page has three distinct sections: 
1. The navigation bar at the top
2. The "About" section with images/text 
3. The "Order" section with user input dialog box

I'm going to tackle each section one at a time, starting with "About" as it seems to be the most simple. 

### Fixing the "About" Section
    
This section features side-by-side images with descriptions ‚Äì¬†a very basic layout that most websites have. To make this mobile-friendly, we simply have to ensure that the images/descriptions can stack on top of each other (or in other words, wrap). 

üß† Which part of the CSS is making these images to be aligned horizontally? 

üí° It looks like `flex-direction` is set to `row`. 

Solution: I add a media query 

```
@media (max-width: 800px) {
    .descriptions {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
```
Explanation: 
`@media (max-with: 800px)` is esentially saying: "As long as the screen is less than 800px..."

This allows us to change the styling of the section when the screen width is less than 800px. 

The images and descriptions are now stacked on top of eachother, but it doesn't look quite right. This is because the width of the images are still set to `33%`, which no longer makes sense for mobile as there is only one image per row. Thus, I can modify the width and heights accordingly to: 

```
@media (max-width: 800px) {
    .descriptions>div {
        width: 100%;
        height: 30%;        
    }
}
```

## Fixing the Navigation Bar 

In responsive design, some sections cannot just be rearranged, but have to be completely reimagined. The "About" section was fairly simple as we merely had to ajdust the positioning and size of the elements. On the other hand, a component like the nav bar is more challenging. It doesn't take long to realize that all of the navigation items will not fit onto the header of a mobile screen. 
    
üß† What can we do instead? 
üí° We can collapse all of the items into a hamburger menu that expands on click. 

1. Firstly, I'll make a toggle button by inserting the following into my HTML page: 

```
   <a href="#" class="toggle-button">
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
   </a>
```
Next, I'll add some styling: 

```
.toggle-button {
    position: absolute;
    top: .75rem;
    right: 1rem;
    display: none;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px;
}
```
Notice `display: none`. This has been added intentionally as the hamburger button *should not show* on desktop. This is a very common technique to hide certain elements based on size when designing for mobile.

Now, I'll use a media query to ensure that the hamburger button *is* displayed when the screen width is narrow enough: 
 
```
@media (max-width: 800px) {

    .toggle-button {
        display: flex;
    }
```
When the toggle button appears on mobile, the navbar items should disappear. I can achieve this by setting `display: none` (within that same media query). 


The rest of the CSS in this media query is to style the menu bar: 
```
       .navbar {
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: flex-start;
    }

    .navbar-links ul {
        width: 100%;
        flex-direction: column;
    }

    .navbar-links ul li {
        text-align: center;
    }

    .navbar-links ul li a {
        padding: .5rem 1rem;
    }
```
    
In order to determine whether the menu items should be shown or not, I will use .active to display the menu items when it is active: 
    
  ```
    .navbar-links.active {
        display: flex;
    }    
```
Finally, I'll have to add some Javascript in order for the toggle button to actually open and close. In my script.js file, I add: 

```
const toggleButton = document.getElementsByClassName('toggle-button')[0]
const navbarLinks = document.getElementsByClassName('navbar-links')[0]

toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    navbarLinks.classList.toggle('active')
})
```
    
## Fixing the "Order" section
To avoid repetition, I'm not going to walk through restyling this section as it is very similar to those above. In a similar fashion, I would use media queries to change the layout as follows: ## EDITTT

## Challenges to consider

The above is a simplified solution to this issue, and there are many other factors that are worth considering:
    
- Prioritization: 
  A smaller device means content is fighting for screen space ‚Äì which sections of the website are the most important and add the deepest value to our       customers. 
- Performance: 
  The performance (speed at which content loads and renders) of a website is strongly correlated to user experience. How can we finetune and optimize our   website's CSS performance and deliver content faster to our customers? 
- Accessibility: 
  How can we ensure that our website design and layout is accessible to all people? Is our website navigation friendly, 
- Modularity
  How scalable is our website? Have we broken up our website into modules that can be easily and flexibly rearranged? Do we have reusable components and     patterns? 
- Testing
  Have we extensively tested our website on various devices to minimize bugs and ensure there is no unexpected behaviour? 

## What *should* the DRUBER team have done?
    
If we could go back in time, the DRUBER team should have first prioritized mobile design, then worked our way up to more complex, desktop screen sizes. Mobile-first design (also known as progressive advancement) is important as it naturally forces developers/designers to understand and identify the most necessary and key elements of a website, without the added fluff. Prioritzing these essential sections and making sure they are properly displayed is vital. Once we have mobile nailed down, we can play around as we expand the design and functionality to account for desktop. ### EDITTTT
